This website was created to showcase my skills to employers. In by website they can navigate to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me. Users are able to click on my work and view it in GitHub. If they would like to contact me through LinkedIn, GitHub, telephone, or email. They are able to do so by clicking those links that will direct them directly to those sites.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
